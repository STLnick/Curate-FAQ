# Curate-FAQ

## The User Story

As an Administrator User Iâ€™d like the ability to manage questions
and answers and have them displayed to end users on a FAQ
page so that I can answer commonly asked questions.

Acceptance Criteria

1. Admins should be able to create, update and delete questions and answers.
2. End Users should be able to view these questions and answers.

### Tech Stack

MongoDB, Express, React, Node

**Story Points for this Story**

- Time: **2pts** Estimate 5hrs
- Effort: **2pts** Minimal - moderate
- Risk: **1pt** Little to none - this is the whole app. We can't break nothing! 
In a production environment it would still be relatively low risk. Biggest risk factor would be ensure we create, update and delete info from the database properly.

Points: 5
